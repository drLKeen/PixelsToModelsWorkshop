## Pixels to Models Content/Overview:

This repository contains the sharable materials from the Pixels-to-Models
seminar. The material is aimed at spanning a wide range of functionality
for analyzing and processing images...from "pure image processing," to
computer vision, to machine learning, to deep learning.



## AGENDA:

From Pixels to Models: Image Processing, Computer Vision, and Machine-
and Deep Learning with Images in MATLAB
Analyzing images efficiently requires selecting the best approach for the job.
Some challenges are best solved with pixel-based analyses; some are best
solved using features; and others necessitate aggregating information from
multiple images in machine- and deep-learning workflows. Transitioning image
models from pixel-based to feature-based allows us to extract information
from images and video at a high level, to detect, classify, and track objects,
co-register images, or understand a real-world scene. Using collections of
features, we can train computers to recognize objects, with user-specified
or automatically determined features. In this session, you will learn about
a wide range of capabilities for image processing and computer vision with
the MATLAB product family, including machine- and deep learning using deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Demos include:
•	Perform automatic image registrations using feature-based approaches
•	Detect and recognize objects in images
•	Ground truth images and video, and train new classifiers
•	Using pre-built networks to create new recognizers in a “transfer-learning-based workflow”
